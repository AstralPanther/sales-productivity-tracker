- Stable version maintained as `web-version-stable.html`

### Development Workflow
1. Create backup before starting work session
2. Make incremental changes with frequent saves
3. Test functionality after each major feature
4. Update version number and changelog
5. Commit to git with descriptive messages
6. Tag releases with version numbers

### Rollback Procedures
- **Immediate rollback**: `cp backups/[latest-stable] web-version.html`
- **Git rollback**: `git checkout [version-tag]`
- **Feature disable**: Use feature flags in future versions
