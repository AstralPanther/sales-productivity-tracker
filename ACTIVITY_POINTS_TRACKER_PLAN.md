# Activity Points Tracker - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A lightweight desktop widget that sits in the taskbar area, visually tracking progress toward daily sales productivity goals. The user must achieve triple targets during an 8-hour shift: 50 activity points, 20 outbound calls, and backlog countdown with flexible start times. All metrics are manually updated in the tracker with comprehensive testing and code quality assurance.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Triple Targets**: 50 activity points + 20 outbound calls + backlog countdown in 8 hours
- **Visual Design**: Three labeled progress bars with independent time indicators
- **Flexible Timing**: Support different shift start times
- **Real-time Updates**: Current progress vs. expected progress at current time for both metrics
- **Minimal UI**: Ultra-compact widget positioned in taskbar empty space
- **Taskbar Integration**: Sits in taskbar area without interfering with Windows UI

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: Windows desktop application
- **Architecture**: Extremely lightweight, minimal resource usage
- **Data Input**: Manual total entry (no hotkeys needed)
- **HubSpot**: Investigate simple API integration, fallback to manual entry
- **Persistence**: Save progress across application restarts
- **Configuration**: Adjustable shift start times and targets

## Visual Design Concept

### Dual Progress Bar Design (Taskbar Version)
```
Two labeled progress bars with shared time scale:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Activity      ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░│░░░░░░░░│ 25/50 │
│ Outbound Calls ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│░░░░░░░░│ 12/20 │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  09   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17
              ↑                    ↑                    
        Expected time         Current time          

Dual independent tracking:
1. Activity Points: Target 50, colored fill based on schedule performance
2. Outbound Calls: Target 20, colored fill based on schedule performance
3. Shared time indicator: Single vertical line for both progress bars
4. Labels: "Activity" and "Outbound Calls" clearly identify each bar
5. Both bars show: fill percentage, color coding, and current/target counts
```

### Color Coding
- **Green**: On track or ahead
- **Yellow**: Slightly behind (within 10% tolerance)
- **Red**: Significantly behind schedule
- **Blue**: Current expected progress line

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
**Option A: Electron + HTML/CSS/JS**
- Pros: Fast development, rich UI capabilities, cross-platform ready
- Cons: Higher memory usage

**Option B: WPF (.NET)**
- Pros: Native Windows integration, lower resource usage
- Cons: Windows-only, requires .NET runtime

**Option C: Python + Tkinter/PyQt**
- Pros: Rapid prototyping, easy to modify
- Cons: Requires Python runtime

**Recommended: Electron** for rapid development and future extensibility

### Single Platform Strategy (Current Status)
**Web Version**: Primary development platform with comprehensive features
- ✅ Complete icon system with emoji goals
- ✅ Motivational "revenue remaining" tooltips
- ✅ Advanced milestone visualization
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Esc)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop goal reordering
- ✅ Context menu integration
- ✅ Month progress indicators
- ✅ Live development server for cross-device testing

**New Requirements** (Multi-Device Experience):
1. **Multi-Page Navigation**: Convert 3 separate dialogs into unified page navigation
   - Main Dashboard (current tracker view)
   - Purchase Goals (revenue planning page)
   - Settings (configuration page)
2. **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Real-time data sync between devices accessing same server
3. **UI Improvements**: Fix tooltip positioning and responsive design issues

**Implementation Priority**:
1. **Page Navigation System** (1-2 hours): Single-page app with tab navigation
2. **Cross-Device Sync** (2-3 hours): WebSocket or polling-based data synchronization
3. **UI Polish** (30 min): Fix tooltip positioning and responsive layout issues

### Core Components - IMPLEMENTED
1. **Main Window**: Always-on-top taskbar widget
2. **Progress Calculator**: Computes expected vs. actual progress
3. **Data Manager**: Handles point entry and persistence
4. **Settings Panel**: Configure shift times and targets
5. **Update Loop**: 30-minute refresh cycle for time indicator

## User Interface Flow

### Main Widget
- Size: Compact horizontal bar (~300x40 pixels)
- Position: Taskbar area (empty space, stays above taskbar)
- Interaction: Click to enter total points, right-click for settings

### Point Entry Methods
1. **Total Entry**: Click widget → enter current total points from HubSpot
2. **HubSpot Integration**: Investigate API for automatic sync (if easy to implement)
3. **Manual Fallback**: Simple number input dialog for manual updates

### Configuration Panel
- Shift start time selector
- Daily target (default: 50 points)
- Widget position and size
- Color scheme preferences
- Reset/clear data options

## Data Model
